# My Resume Website

This is my very first web development project, created as part of my learning journey on Udemy. I initially encountered HTML during my elementary school years, but I’ve recently decided to dive deeper into web development. It has been a rewarding and fun experience so far!

## Project Overview
This project is a simple personal resume website that showcases my professional background, education, technical skills, and work experience. It was built using basic HTML, and it serves as a practice exercise to solidify my understanding of core web development concepts.

## Features
- **Profile Section:** Includes a profile picture and a link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/custodioannabellem/) page.
- **Education:** Highlights my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a specialization in Applied Statistics.
- **Technical Skills:** Lists the programming languages, tools, and operating systems I’m familiar with.
- **Projects:** Includes a summary of my undergraduate thesis and the tools used.
- **Work Experience:** Provides a brief overview of my professional roles so far.
- **Other Interests:** Links to separate pages about my hobbies and how to contact me.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS** (planned for future enhancement)
- **Basic image and hyperlink embedding**

## Future Improvements
- Add CSS for better styling and layout.
- Make the website responsive for different screen sizes.
- Add more interactive elements, such as JavaScript for form handling.
